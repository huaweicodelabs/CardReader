## Introduction :

CardReader App will give insight about how HMS ML kit, Scan kit, and Fido kit can be used for Business&Office purpose category and how we can make the card scanning 
easy. This app demonstrate on how end user can scan the Bank Cards, General Cards(Business, PAN Card and Adhaar Card) and save it in the app. Whenver required User can open the app and see the stored card details. As a Safety purpose the Details of the card can only be seen after authentication using PIN Lock or FingerPrint or 
3D-FaceRecognition. App is developed using below HMS Features.

## What You Will Create

In this code lab, you will create a CardReader Demo project and use the APIs of HUAWEI ML, Scan and Fido. We are going to create a end to end prototype for scanning the different type of cards (General,Bank cards) and store it in the app.

*	Recognizing bank cards and general cards using ML Kit
*	Generate QR code and share
*	PIN/Fingerprint/Face Authentication using FIDO kit

## What You Will Learn

In this code lab, you will learn how to:
*	Integrate HUAWEI ML Kit.
*	Integrate Scan Kit. 
*	Integrate Fido .

## What You Will Need

### Hardware Requirements

*	A computer (desktop or laptop) that runs the Windows 10 operating system
*	Huawei phone with HMS Core (APK) 5.0.0.300 or later installed
```
**Note:** Please prepare the preceding hardware environment and relevant devices in advance.
```
### Software Requirements

*	[Android Studio 3.X](https://developer.android.com/studio)
*	JDK 1.8 and later 
*	SDK Platform 23 and later
*	Gradle 4.6 and later

```
**Note:** Please prepare the preceding software environment in advance.
> Only EMUI 4 (API Level 23) and later versions support fingerprint authentication. In addition, ensure that the mobile phone hardware supports fingerprint authentication
> Only EMUI 10 (API Level 29) and later versions support 3D facial authentication. In addition, the device hardware must support 3D facial authentication. Currently, only Mate 20 Pro and Mate 30 Pro support 3D facial authentication.
```

## Prepare Initial configuration

Use the below link to do initial configuration for the application development
https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/codelab/HMSPreparation/index.html#3

## Enable HUAWEI Service(s) in AGC console

Enable the API permission for below kits from Project Settings, Manage APIs and enable the API permission.
*	ML Kit
*	Fido Kit
*	Scan Kit (is a standalone sdk, no need of any configuration in AGC)

```
**Note:** Some APIâ€™s will be enabled by default. If not enable it manually.
```
